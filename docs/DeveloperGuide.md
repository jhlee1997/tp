LingoGO! is a **desktop app** for **university students who use English as their first language** and are trying to **learn a
new language**. Founded on the widely established learning technique of **spaced-repetition**, LingoGO! takes all the
benefits of pen-and-paper flashcards in learning, and brings them to the next level with our **powerful indexing** and **sharing
features** -- *without the hassle* of managing actual physical ones. Coupled with our unique **Command Line Interface (CLI)** and
an elegant **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** to accompany it, LingoGO! is sure to delight you, and empower you on your
journey in mastering the new language you *have always wanted*.

LingoGO! currently supports **all languages that can be represented on your computer** and has the following main features:
* Addition, deletion, and editing of flashcards.
* Finding and filtering of flashcards by keywords and conditions.
* Importing and exporting of flashcards to be shared with others.
* Testing your knowledge in a questionnaire of flashcards.

Detailed information about these features can be found under the [Modes](UserGuide/#modes) and [Commands](UserGuide/#commands) sections in the user guide.

### Architecture

The *Architecture Diagram* below explains the high-level design of the app.

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

**Main components of the architecture**

Given below is a quick overview of the main components and how they interact with each other.

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/lingogo/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/lingogo/MainApp.java).
It has the following responsibilities:
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the app consists of **four components**.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above):

* Defines its API in an interface with the same name as the component.
* Implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class, which follows the corresponding API interface in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class, which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component),

We can see an illustration of this in the (partial) *Class Diagram* below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details on each component.

### UI component

**API** : [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/lingogo/ui/Ui.java)

The `UI` component contains the logic for the graphical user interface (GUI) that users see.

An overall *Class Diagram* for this component can be found below:

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The `UI` component consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of several sub-components (e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `FlashcardListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter`, etc.) which come together to make up the entire user interface. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/lingogo/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* Keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* Depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Flashcard` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/lingogo/logic/Logic.java)

The `Logic` component is responsible for the overall flow of the commands in LingoGO!, linking `UI`, `Model`, and `Storage` together.

A (partial) *Class Diagram* of the `Logic` component can be found below:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `FlashcardAppParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This creates a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a flashcard).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated in a `CommandResult` object which is returned by `Logic`.

The *Sequence Diagram* below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the *Class Diagram* above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `FlashcardAppParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`)
* `XYZCommandParser` uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `FlashcardAppParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible (e.g., during testing).

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/lingogo/model/Model.java)

The `Model` component holds the data of LingoGO! in memory while the app is running.

A *Class Diagram* of the `Model` component can be found below:

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component:

* Stores the flashcard app data i.e., all `Flashcard` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueFlashcardList` object).
* Stores the currently 'selected' `Flashcard` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a **separate filtered list** which is exposed as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Flashcard>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the `UI` can be bound to this list so that the `UI` automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* Stores the slideshow app data i.e., all `Flashcard` objects in the slideshow (which are contained in a `Slideshow` object). This is exposed as a `ReadOnlySlideshowApp` object.
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, it should make sense on its own without depending on other components).

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/lingogo/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component stores all of LingoGO!'s data so that it can be saved and retrieved in subsequent runs of the app.

A *Class Diagram* of the `Storage` component can be found below:

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component:
* Can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* Inherits from both `FlashcardAppStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if the functionality of only one is needed).
* Depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `lingogo.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Feature Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Filter feature

#### Description
The filter feature allows users to quickly select a group of flashcards to be shown in the displayed flashcards list
of the GUI. This effectively enables users to "prepare" a batch of flashcards for a test session. The command
accepts various conditions from the user to filter the flashcards with. (e.g. what type of
language, which card indexes).

#### Implementation

The filter feature is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It extends `Model` and implements `updateFilteredFlashcardList`
which returns an unmodifiable view of filtered flashcards in the GUI.

The filter feature also relies on a nested `FilterBuilder` class within `FilterCommand`. Multiple filters can be
given by the user in one command, however only one predicate (filter) can be accepted by
`Model::updateFilteredFlashList` to produce the filtered flashcards. `FilterBuilder` helps by combining multiple
predicates into a single predicate.

`FilterBuilder` is also a mutable class which allows processed user inputs to be directly set as variables within a
`FilterBuilder` instance. A mutable design is acceptable for `FilterBuilder` since it only has a one-time usage within
`FilterCommand`. Furthermore, set-variable methods in `FilterBuilder` reduces the need to add unnecessarily
complex constructors or factory methods when more types of filters are added.


The following sequence diagrams shows how the filter operation works:

![FilterSequenceDiagram](images/filterCommand/FilterSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FilterCommand`,
`FilterCommandParser` and `FilterBuilder`should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

![SetFilterReferenceSequenceDiagram](images/filterCommand/SetFilterReferenceSequenceDiagram.png)


#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Number of filter conditions that users can input per command:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Accept multiple conditions per command.
  * Pros: More convenient for users, creating a better user experience.
  * Cons: Harder to implement and more difficult to test (due to large permutations of different conditions to
    consider).

* **Alternative 2:** Only accept one condition per command.
  * Pros: Easier to implement.
  * Cons: Less convenient for users.

**Aspect: Mutability of `FilterBuilder`**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make it mutable.
    * Pros: No need for complex constructors and easier for more types of filters to be added in the future.
    * Cons: Less defensive code and easier for bugs to arise due to programmer error.

* **Alternative 2:** Make it immutable.
    * Pros: More defensive code.
    * Cons: There is a need for multiple constructors to handle optional user inputs due to a lack of set-variable
      methods. Furthermore `FilterCommandParser` may become needlessly complex.

### Export feature

#### Implementation

The export feature is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It extends `Model` and implements `exportFlashcards`
which creates a CSV file in the `data` folder.

The export feature uses `CSVWriter` class which generates a CSV file
line by line in the file specified by the user.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![ExportSequenceDiagram](images/ExportSequenceDiagram.png)

### Import feature

#### Implementation

The import feature is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It extends `Model` and implements `importFlashcards`
which returns an updated view of the flashcards in the GUI.

The import feature uses `CSVReader` class to check if the given CSV file
is in the correct format line by line and uploads each card to the flashcard list
if there is no duplicate.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![ImportSequenceDiagram](images/ImportSequenceDiagram.png)

### Find feature

#### Implementation

The find feature is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It extends `Model` implements `updateFilteredFlashcardList` which returns an unmodifiable view of flashcards matching the specified keywords in the GUI.

The find feature relies on the `FindCommandParser` and `PhraseContainsKeywordsPredicate`. Multiple keywords can be given for both english and foreign phrases. `FindCommandParser` uses `PhraseContainsKeywordsPredicate` to select flashcards that matches the keywords.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to search in foreign language:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow non-full match
  * Pros: Will not miss out any related flashcards that is related to the keyword provided.
  * Cons: May output a lot more flashcards than the user's desired outcome.

* **Alternative 2:** Only allow full match
  * Pros: Only exact match will be output, user will only see flashcards that are exactly the keyword.
  * Cons: Too restrictive, will not output phrases that contains more than the keyword.


### List feature

#### Implementation

The list feature is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It extends `Model` and implements `updateFilteredFlashcardList` which returns an unmodifiable view of the flashcards in the GUI.

The list feature relies on the `ListCommandParser` and `FlashcardInGivenFlashcardListPredicate`. In order to generate a list of random flashcards, a random stream of `Index` is used to get the flashcards from the main list of flashcards.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the execution of `ListCommand`.

![ListSequenceDiagram](images/ListSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Generating list of flashcards:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Randomise the list of flashcards
    * Pros: Users are able to use flashcards more effectively.
    * Cons: Harder to implement and needs a random stream of `Index`.

* **Alternative 2:** Output list up to `n`
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Does not add value to the user's learning experience.

### Slideshow feature

#### Description

The slideshow feature displays the flashcards shown in list mode one at a time in individual "slides".
In slideshow mode, users can test how well they remember their flashcards by entering their answers for each flashcard
and getting feedback on whether they are right or wrong. Users may also navigate between "slides".

#### Implementation

The slideshow feature is facilitated by `ModelManager`.
It extends `Model` and implements `startSlideshow`, `stopSlideshow`, `isSlideshowActive`, `slideshowNextFlashcard`,
`slideshowPreviousFlashcard`, `answerCurrentSlide`, `displayCurrentAnswer`, `getSlideshowApp`, and `getCurrentSlide`.

The above methods in turn facilitate the following commands:
* `SlideshowCommand` - When the user enters slideshow mode.
* `AnswerCommand` - When the user enters an answer for the flashcard shown on the current slide.
* `NextCommand` - When the user navigates to the next slide.
* `PreviousCommand` - When the user navigates to the previous slide.
* `StopCommand` - When the user exits slideshow mode.

The `SlideshowApp` class is used to encapsulate all state and operations related to the slideshow.
It is exposed as a `ReadOnlySlideshowApp` object.

The following sequence diagrams shows how the slideshow command works:

![SlideshowSequenceDiagram](images/SlideshowSequenceDiagram.png)

![UpdateSlideshowAppReferenceSequenceDiagram](images/UpdateSlideshowAppReferenceSequenceDIagram.png)

The reference sequence diagram above shows the various state changes within `SlideshowApp`.
When a certain property is changed, the UI updates itself accordingly.
The relevant `UiPart` listens to changes in these properties using the `ChangeListener` class provided by `java.beans`.

For instance, when `isActive:BooleanProperty` becomes true, the UI will go into slideshow mode.
Below is a code snippet on how this is implemented in `FlashcardListPanel.java`.

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and Shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder.

   2. Double-click the jar file <br>
       Expected snapshot: 
        ![initial start up](images/developerGuideExpectedSnapshots/initialStartUp.png)

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.


### Deleting a Flashcard

1. Deleting a flashcard while all flashcards are listed

   1. Prerequisites: List all flashcards using the `list` command. Multiple flashcards are in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First flashcard is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted flashcard (e.g. Language type, English Phrase, Foreign Phrase) shown in the command result. Command box will be cleared.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No flashcard is deleted. Error details (e.g. Error type and Message Usage) shown in the command result. The `delete 0` command will remain in the command box.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

### Loading in a JSON data file

1. Loading valid JSON data file
    
    1. Prerequisites: Sample `flashcardapp.json` file is filled with following data and is inside a `data` directory in 
       the same directory as the jar file:
       ```
        {
            "flashcards" : [ {
            "languageType" : "Chinese",
            "englishPhrase" : "Hello",
            "foreignPhrase" : "你好"
            }, {
            "languageType" : "Chinese",
            "englishPhrase" : "Good Morning",
            "foreignPhrase" : "早安"
            }, {
