## Modes

Before diving into the specific commands, let's have an overview of the different modes in LingoGO!.

LingoGO! has two main modes, [List mode](#list-mode) and [Slideshow mode](#slideshow-mode), through which users can interact with
the application. At a high level, List mode provides an intuitive table overview to manage flashcards with our powerful and flexible indexing features. In contrast, Slideshow mode allows users to test their knowledge on selected flashcards one by one in a questionnaire-style interface while retaining the feel and look of traditional flashcards.

The following two sections will describe these modes in further detail.

### List mode

Below is an example of what LingoGO! looks like in List mode.

![Ui](images/Ui.png)

LingoGO! always starts in List mode and displays all of your flashcards.

List mode lets you [`add`](#adding-a-flashcard-add), [`delete`](#deleting-a-flashcard--delete),
[`edit`](#editing-a-flashcard--edit), [`import`](#importing-flashcards--import), and [`export`](#exporting-flashcards--export)
flashcards.

List mode also lets you choose what flashcards to display. The displayed flashcards
will be the flashcards you get tested on when you switch to [Slideshow mode](#slideshow-mode).
You can use the [`list`](#listing-flashcards--list), [`filter`](#filtering-flashcards-by-conditions-filter), or
[`find`](#locating-flashcards-by-keywords-find) command to choose which flashcards to display.

### Slideshow mode

Below is an example of what LingoGO! looks like in Slideshow mode.

![Slideshow](images/Slideshow.png)

Slideshow mode tests your knowledge by showing you flashcards one at a time. The flashcards shown to you are the ones
displayed in list mode.

To enter and exit slideshow mode, use the [`slideshow`](#testing-with-a-set-of-flashcards--slideshow) and [`stop`](#exiting-slideshow-mode-stop) commands respectively.

In slideshow mode, you can:
* Move to [`next`](#moving-to-the-next-flashcard-in-slideshow-mode--next) or
  [`previous`](#moving-to-the-previous-flashcard-in-slideshow-mode--previous) flashcards
* Enter an [`answer`](#answering-a-flashcard--answer) for a flashcard

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about slideshow mode:**<br>

* If your flashcards have phrases that are too long to be displayed, you can **increase the app's window size**.

</div>

<hr/>

## Commands

The following section gives an in-depth overview of each command in the application, and provides some examples on their usages.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by you.
  * e.g. a usage of `add l/LANGUAGE e/ENGLISH_PHRASE f/FOREIGN_PHRASE` could be `add l/Chinese e/Good Morning f/早安`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.
  * e.g. `edit INDEX [l/LANGUAGE] [e/ENGLISH_PHRASE] [f/FOREIGN_PHRASE]` can be used as `edit 1 l/Chinese e/Good Morning f/早安` or `edit 1 e/Good Morning`.

* Parameters can be in any order.
  * e.g. if the command specifies `add l/LANGUAGE e/ENGLISH_PHRASE f/FOREIGN_PHRASE`, `add f/FOREIGN_PHRASE l/LANGUAGE e/ENGLISH_PHRASE` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence will be taken.
  * e.g. `edit 2 e/Hi e/Hello` is the same as `edit 2 e/Hello`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help` and `clear`) will be ignored.
  * e.g. `help 123` is the same as `help`.

</div>


### Adding a flashcard: `add`

Adds a flashcard to LingoGO!.
* This command can only be run in [List mode](#list-mode).
* The flashcard will be added to the bottom of the displayed flashcard list in [List mode](#list-mode).

Format: `add l/LANGUAGE e/ENGLISH_PHRASE f/FOREIGN_PHRASE`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about adding flashcards:**<br>

* `ENGLISH_PHRASE` and `FOREIGN_PHRASE` should not be longer than **100 characters**.
  For optimal viewing experience, flashcard phrases should be kept as short as possible.
  If your phrases are too long to be displayed, you can **increase the app's window size**.
* `LANGUAGE` should not be longer than **50 characters**.
* Make sure that you are able to distinguish between the different foreign phrases, otherwise the [`answer`](#answering-a-flashcard--answer) command in [Slideshow mode](#slideshow-mode) would not be beneficial for your testing of knowledge.

</div>
* `LANGUAGE` only allows alphabetic characters which will be **capitalized** when the flashcard is added (e.g. "CHINESE" will be saved as "Chinese").
* `ENGLISH_PHRASE` is not restricted to alphabetic characters, it is **recommended** that users ensure that `ENGLISH_PHRASE` is a valid English input.

Examples:
* `add l/Chinese e/Good Morning f/早安`


### Answering a flashcard : `answer`

Checks whether the English phrase of a flashcard matches the phrase you provide.
* This command can only be run in [Slideshow mode](#slideshow-mode).

Format: `answer e/ENGLISH_PHRASE`

* Checks the English phrase of the displayed flashcard against the `ENGLISH_PHRASE` you provide.
* The app will then show the correct English phrase and tell you whether you got it right.
* `ENGLISH_PHRASE` is not case-sensitive (e.g. "HeLLo" matches "hello").
* You can only answer a flashcard in [Slideshow mode](#slideshow-mode), and you can only answer it once.

Examples:
* `answer e/hello` checks the English phrase of the flashcard on display to see if `hello` matches it.

* The CSV file will have **3 columns** in this order from left to right:
  1. Language
  1. Foreign phrase
  1. English phrase

Examples:
* `export myCards.csv` will save all cards in LingoGO! to a CSV file named `myCards.csv`.


### Filtering flashcards by condition(s): `filter`

Filters flashcards based on specified condition(s), such that only flashcards matching **any of the given conditions** remain in the displayed flashcard list of [List mode](#list-mode).
* This command can only be run in [List mode](#list-mode).

Format: `filter [l/LANGUAGE] [i/INDEX_LIST] [r/INDEX_RANGE]`


* The `filter` search will apply **only on flashcards in the displayed flashcard list of [List mode](#list-mode)**. 
  Flashcards not in the displayed flashcard list will not subsequently show up even if a `filter` command with matching conditions is executed. 
  (Refer to the last `filter` example).
* `LANGUAGE` is not **case-sensitive** (e.g. "Chinese" matches "CHINESE").
* `INDEX_LIST` is a list of space separated indices, that refer to the indices shown in the displayed flashcard list of [List mode](#list-mode).
* `INDEX_RANGE` is a pair of space separated indices, that refer to the indices shown in the displayed flashcard list of [List mode](#list-mode).
  The given range is inclusive, that is `1 3` would refer to the flashcards at indices 1, 2 and 3. Additionally, the first given
  index must be smaller or equal to the second given index. e.g. `1 2`, `3 14` are accepted but not `1 2 3` nor `3 1`.
* The indices **must be positive integers** 1, 2, 3, …
* **At least one** of the optional fields must be provided.


Examples:
* `filter l/Chinese` returns all flashcards in the displayed flashcard list of [List mode](#list-mode) with the `Chinese` language like `e/Good Morning f/早安 l/Chinese`.
* `filter i/1 2 3` returns the flashcards in the displayed flashcard list of [List mode](#list-mode) indexed at 1, 2 and 3.

* `filter l/Chinese r/1 4` returns all the flashcards in the displayed flashcard list of [List mode](#list-mode) indexed from 1 to 4, **or** of `Chinese` language.
* `filter l/French r/1 10 i/15 19 20` returns all flashcards in the displayed flashcard list of [List mode](#list-mode) indexed from 1 to 10 **or** 
  indexed at 15, 19 and 20  **or** of the `French` language.
*  When the displayed flashcard list of [List mode](#list-mode) shows `e/Good Morning f/早安 l/Chinese` and 
   `e/hand f/손 l/Korean`, executing `filter l/Korean` will return a displayed flashcard list with only the `e/hand f/손 l/Korean` 
   flashcard left. If we then execute `filter l/Chinese`, an empty displayed flashcard list will be returned. 

### Locating flashcards by keyword(s): `find`

Finds flashcards from the **entire** flashcard list based on the keyword(s) specified.
* This command can only be run in [List mode](#list-mode).

Format: `find [e/ENGLISH_KEYWORDS] [f/FOREIGN_KEYWORDS]`

* The search for english keywords is **not case-sensitive**, e.g "HELLO" will match "Hello".
* The search for foreign keywords is **case-sensitive** because some language depends on capitalization rules, e.g. in German, "Morgen" translates to "morning" but "morgen" translates to "tomorrow".
* The **order** of the keywords **does not matter**, e.g. "Good morning" will match "Morning good".
* Only **full words** will be matched for **English keywords**, e.g. "Fire" will **not** match "Fireworks".
* **Non-full words** match will be accepted for **foreign keywords**, e.g. "早" with match "早安".
